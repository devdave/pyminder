# Project notes

The bulk of the project is done, and now it is down to the 80:20 rule.  
80% of a project takes 20% of the time but the last 20% takes 80% of the time.

Some rough tests show the app is consuming 300MB of memory and the exe is ~52MB. 
I feel like I can make the installer smaller, but it feels like it would be a waste of effort to try
and save more memory.
