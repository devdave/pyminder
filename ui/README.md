# User interface sub-program

## Environment

I am running eslint + prettier in the background of my IDE.

## Points of interest

- `src/brokers` are a quasi-mixture of hooks and last tier wrappers around the API bridge between react and python.
- `src/api` is autogenerated bridge code to the python backend
- `src/library` miscellaneous utilities and helpers
- `src/windows` need to delete, failed experiment

## Load order
`index.html` calls `src/main` calls `src/app` which leads to `src/router`

Router manages connections to `src/pages`

## TODOs

1. Pull more of the Providers into main
2. General cleanup
3. Figure out wtf is up with DataTable's styling issues.
